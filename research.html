  <!-- 🔬 Research Overview -->
  <header>
    <h1>Research</h1>
    <p>
      Our lab studies the dynamic interplay between neural, glial, and vascular systems that shape cortical function. 
      Using multimodal imaging, electrophysiology, and behavioral tracking, we aim to uncover how brain states 
      emerge from complex biological coordination.

  <section>
    <h2>Neurovascular Coupling</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        We investigate how neuronal activity drives vascular responses at multiple scales. 
        Through wide-field optical imaging (Ca/CBV) and EEG, our experiments measure how oxygenation and neural activation 
        synchronize across cortical regions. This work enhances understanding of brain energy dynamics, 
        and informs translational models of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

    <h2>Behavioral Correlates of Cortical Activity</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        Our behavioral tracking systems link real-time movement and decision-making with neural patterns. 
        We analyze open-field exploration, zero maze, and object interaction tests to quantify the 
        neural signatures of anxiety, curiosity, and habituation. 
        These paradigms are integrated with optical and EEG modalities to build comprehensive models of behavior–brain coupling.

  <!-- ⚡ Section: Multimodal Integration -->
  <section>
    <h2>Multimodal Data Integration</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        By combining wide-field optical imaging, EEG, and computational models, we create a unified framework 
        for analyzing large-scale cortical dynamics. Our pipelines include automated motion tracking, 
        state segmentation, and cross-modal time-series correlation. 
        These tools are being developed as open-source frameworks for the neuroscience community.

  <!-- 💡 Section: Translational Applications -->
  <section>
    <h2>Translational and Therapeutic Insights</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <p>
        We aim to connect fundamental neuroscience to clinical outcomes. 
        By mapping cortical biomarkers of plasticity, stress response, and altered neurovascular signaling, 
        we hope to advance translational research relevant to developmental, behavioral, and neurodegenerative disorders. 
        Our long-term goal is to build predictive and therapeutic models for brain health and recovery.
